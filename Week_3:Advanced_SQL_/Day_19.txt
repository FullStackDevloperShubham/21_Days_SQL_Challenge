 Day 19: Security & User Management

 1. Why Security & User Management?
In databases, security ensures that only the right users can access or modify the data.

User management means creating users, giving them permissions, or removing them when needed.

2. Important Concepts
ðŸ‘‰ Roles
A role is like a group or profile.

You can assign permissions to a role, and then assign that role to users.

Roles make permission management easier!

 Create a role:

CREATE ROLE manager;

 Create a role with login:

 CREATE ROLE analyst WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password123';

 Assign a role to a user:

GRANT manager TO analyst;

GRANT
GRANT is used to give permissions (privileges) to a user or role.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Grant SELECT permission on a table:

GRANT SELECT ON employees TO analyst;

Grant multiple permissions:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO analyst;

REVOKE
REVOKE is used to remove permissions.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Revoke SELECT permission:

REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM analyst;

Revoke multiple permissions:

REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON employees FROM analyst;
