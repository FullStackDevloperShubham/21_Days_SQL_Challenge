Day 1: Introduction to SQL & PostgreSQL - Setting up PostgreSQL, Basic syntax and structure.

Ans : 📘 What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It allows you to:

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data.

Define and manage schema (tables, columns, relationships).

Perform operations like joins, filters, sorting, and aggregations.

🐘 What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system. It's widely used for modern full-stack development due to its:

Advanced features (like JSONB, full-text search, and indexing)

Reliability

Open-source support

🛠️ Step 1: Setting up PostgreSQL
🔸 Option 1: Local Installation
Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Use pgAdmin for GUI (optional but helpful).

 Option 2: Use Docker
 docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=shubham123 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres


🧠 Step 2: Basic SQL Syntax
 # Create a Table
 CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  age INT
);

📌 Insert Data
INSERT INTO users (name, email, age)
VALUES ('Shubham', 'shubham@example.com', 23);

📌 Select Data
SELECT * FROM users;

📌 Update Data
UPDATE users
SET age = 24
WHERE name = 'Shubham';

📌 Delete Data
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
