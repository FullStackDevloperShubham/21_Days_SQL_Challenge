🎯 Focus: ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET — Sorting & Limiting Data
🔢 ORDER BY – Sorting the Result Set
You use ORDER BY to sort rows based on one or more columns.

Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, age
FROM students
ORDER BY age ASC;  -- or DESC for descending order
🎯 LIMIT – Restrict the Number of Rows Returned
This is used to fetch a specific number of rows.

Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM books
LIMIT 5;
✅ Returns only the first 5 rows from the books table.

⏩ OFFSET – Skip a Specific Number of Rows
Use OFFSET to skip rows before starting to return rows.

Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT number OFFSET offset_value;
Example (Pagination):

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM books
ORDER BY title
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
📚 This gets the 2nd page of results assuming a page size of 5.

📚 Practical Example (Combined):
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, marks
FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
➡️ This returns the 11th to 20th top-scoring students.
