FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];


ðŸŽ¯ LIMIT â€“ Restrict the Number of Rows Returned
This is used to fetch a specific number of rows.

SELECT * FROM table_name

OFFSET â€“ Skip a Specific Number of Rows
Use OFFSET to skip rows before starting to return rows.

SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT number OFFSET offset_value;
