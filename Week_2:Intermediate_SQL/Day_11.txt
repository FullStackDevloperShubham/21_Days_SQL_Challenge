Day 11: Window Functions - ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK().

üîç What Are Window Functions?
Window functions perform a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, they don't collapse rows ‚Äì they preserve the number of rows.

The general syntax:

function_name() OVER (
  PARTITION BY column_name
  ORDER BY column_name
)

‚úÖ 1. ROW_NUMBER()
Gives a unique sequential number to each row within a partition, without handling ties.

üìå Use case: You want to assign a unique number to each row, like serial numbers per group.

SELECT 
  name, department, salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;

‚úÖ 2. RANK()
Ranks rows within a partition based on ORDER BY. Ties get the same rank, and skips the next rank(s).

üìå Use case: You want to rank students, and ties get same rank but the next rank is skipped.

SELECT 
  name, department, salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;

‚úÖ 3. DENSE_RANK()
Same as RANK() but does not skip the next rank after a tie.

üìå Use case: You want to assign compact ranks without gaps in case of ties.

SELECT 
  name, department, salary,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
