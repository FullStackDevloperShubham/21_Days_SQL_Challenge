Day 9: Subqueries & CTEs - Writing subqueries, using WITH.

Subqueries (Nested Queries)

A subquery is a query within a query.

ðŸ“Œ Syntax:

SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column2 = (
  SELECT column2
  FROM table2
  WHERE condition
);
âœ… Example:
Find employees who earn more than the average salary.


SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary)
  FROM employees
);
You can use subqueries in:

WHERE

FROM

SELECT clauses

ðŸ“¦ CTEs (WITH Clause)
CTEs make your queries more readable and are reusable within the query.

ðŸ“Œ Syntax:

WITH cte_name AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table
  WHERE condition
)
SELECT *
FROM cte_name
WHERE column1 = 'some_value';
âœ… Example:
Get the department with the highest average salary.


WITH DeptAvg AS (
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT *
FROM DeptAvg
WHERE avg_salary = (
  SELECT MAX(avg_salary)
  FROM DeptAvg
);
