ðŸ”¸ 1. INNER JOIN
Returns only the matching rows from both tables based on the specified condition.

âœ… Use When:
You only want records that exist in both tables.

ðŸ“¦ Syntax:

SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM tableA a
INNER JOIN tableB b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
ðŸŽ¯ Example:

SELECT students.name, enrollments.course
FROM students
INNER JOIN enrollments
ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
Only students who have enrolled in at least one course will be shown.

ðŸ”¸ 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match, the result is NULL from the right side.

âœ… Use When:
You want all records from the left table, even if there's no match in the right.

ðŸ“¦ Syntax:

SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM tableA a
LEFT JOIN tableB b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
ðŸŽ¯ Example:

SELECT students.name, enrollments.course
FROM students
LEFT JOIN enrollments
ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
This will include all students, even those who havenâ€™t enrolled in any course (course will show as NULL).

ðŸ”¸ 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

ðŸ“¦ Syntax:

SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM tableA a
RIGHT JOIN tableB b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
ðŸŽ¯ Example:

SELECT students.name, enrollments.course
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN enrollments
ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
