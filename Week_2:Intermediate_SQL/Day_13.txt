SQL Transactions: BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit of work. It's all or nothing â€” either all operations succeed (commit), or all fail (rollback).

1. BEGIN (or START TRANSACTION)
Starts a new transaction.

BEGIN;
-- OR
START TRANSACTION;

 2. COMMIT
Saves all changes made during the current transaction.

COMMIT;

3. ROLLBACK
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction.

ROLLBACK;

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;

-- If everything is fine
COMMIT;

-- If something fails
-- ROLLBACK;
